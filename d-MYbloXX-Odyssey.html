                                    <br>
                                    <b>NOTE:</b> After installation, your device will automatically reboot back into a jailbroken state…<br><br>
                                    <b>PLEASE OPEN THE MYBLOXX APP AFTER REBOOT TO CONTINUE INSTALLATION OF MYBLOXX!</b>
                                    <br>

    What makes MYbloXX better than other solutions such as MegaUHB, BlockYouX or AppStore ad-blocking apps you ask?
                                    <br><br>
    In a nutshell: Faster browsing, better battery life and auto-updating… But how?
<br>
    <br>
    The problem with ad-blocking tweaks like MegaUHB and BlockYouX is that they rely on hosts file modifications to block ads... Not only is this static, requiring constant manual additions to the file and pushes of Cydia package updates (rarely done) but it also takes a toll on your download/upload speed...<br>
    <br>
    That’s where MYbloXX comes in!
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Security is a top priority for everyone... MYbloXX ensures that remains top of the list. That's why we don't use third-party Proxy servers, for example, ffapple... Who knows who is looking at all of your traffic when using those?! And then there's the third-party DNS apps like DNSCloak where your traffic is again, routed through a third-party (DNS) server. MYbloXX is different in that everything is proxied locally ON YOUR OWN DEVICE. Unlike the others, EVERYTHING is in clear plain-text format so you're able to view exactly how MYbloXX works and what it's doing.
                                    <br><br>
                                MYbloXX is a simple configuration profile that uses JavaScript to check against specified rules within a PAC file. If the domain requested is within the PAC's list, it will route to a blackhole. The PAC congifuration uses wildcards to more effeciently block targeted ad-servers and known domain structures like http://ad._____
                                    <br><br>The use of wildcards means we can remove a vast majority of entries within the hosts file to ensure a fast, efficient ad-blocking method.
                                    <br><br>MYbloXX uses a powerful Apple stock feature that is usually only available to those with "supervised" devices. It also allows for on-the-fly updates to quickly add new ad-servers and works on all versions of iOS, all carriers and ISP’s (IPv4 and IPv6 respectively...
                                    <br><br>MYbloXX aims to block as many ads as possible out of the box using a technique that has not been used in any other ad-blocking tweaks until now. With new ad servers being created on a daily basis, on rare occasions, it’s possible you’ll come across an ad in an app/on a website.<br><br> If this happens, please use the MYbloXX app to submit a report… The more that use this feature, the better!<br><br>Ad-servers that are added to MYbloXX will be updated automatically on your device as well as a weekly hosts update, providing constant up-to-date protection by the minute.

This is a restriction set in place by Apple on a system level due to the nature of the profile.
