“Since my ISP removed the option to change DNS, I wasn’t able to use AdGuard DNS anymore. MYXXdev released the first beta which went so smooth and buttery that I liked it a lot and became a loyal user.

“I’ve been a beta tester for MYbloXX and it’s been strong from the get-go! The dev really does commit to his tweak and pushes daily updates so we can get the best experience possible.

    <br>The problem with alternate ad-blocking tweaks is that they rely on hosts file modifications to block ads... Not only is this static, requiring constant manual additions to the file and pushes of package updates (rarely done) but it also takes a toll on your download/upload speed... The more rules in the hosts file, the longer it takes to render pages. This method also requires additional tweaks (LetMeBlock and mDNSrestart) to allow mDNSresponder’s use of the hosts file. This is also a strain on system daemons which causes a significant amount of battery drain, especially if mDNSresponder goes haywire, which it’s known to do.
 <br>
    <br>
    That’s where MYbloXX for iOS comes in!
                                    <br>
                                    <br>
                                                    Security is a top priority for everybody... MYbloXX for iOS is no different. This uses absolutely no third-party servers to re-route your traffic, unlike ffapple and other third-party DNS/Ad blocking App Store apps. They claim to not do so but how do we REALLY know that? MYbloXX for iOS is different: All traffic is routed DIRECT...
                                    <br><br>
                                MYbloXX for iOS is a simple configuration profile that uses JavaScript to check against specified rules within a PAC file. If the domain requested is within the PAC's rule list, it will sinkhole. The PAC congifuration uses wildcards to more effeciently block targeted ad-servers and known domain structures like http://ad._____
                                    <br><br>The use of wildcards means a vast majority of entries within the hosts file can be removed to ensure a fast, efficient ad-blocking method.
                                    <br><br>MYbloXX uses a powerful Apple stock feature that is usually only available to those with "supervised" devices. It also allows for on-the-fly updates to quickly add new ad-servers and works on all versions of iOS, all carriers and ISP’s (IPv4 and IPv6 respectively...
                                <br><br><b>So... Just how effective is MYbloXX for iOS and how does it stack up against the competition?</b>
<br><br>
It was put to the test against 2 other popular ad-blocking tweaks (BlockYouX & Mega UHB) using adblock-tester.com

The numbers speak for themselves! All 3 tests were conducted using the following settings:

Mega UHB: 81/100<br>
BlockYouX: 72/100
<br><br>
Gif image and static image tests were turned off because I’ve decided not to attempt to block these... Why? Although possible, it’s highly likely it would have an adverse effect, potentially blocking legitimate GIF’s (now that they’re hugely popular on social media) and small images. This ad technique is pretty antiquated at this point either way and most do not do this anymore. 
                                    <br><br>MYbloXX for iOS aims to block as many ads as possible out of the box using a technique that has not been used in any other ad-blocking tweaks until now. With new ad servers being created on a daily basis, on rare occasions, it’s possible you’ll come across an ad in an app/on a website.<br><br> If this happens, please use the MYbloXX app to submit a report or reach out via Telegram: <a href="https://t.me/MYXXdevSupport">MYXXdev Support Group.</a> The more that use this feature, the better!
<br><br>Ad-servers that are added to MYbloXX for iOS will be updated AUTOMATICALLY on your device providing up to the minute protection from ads, revokes, trackers, miners and all other malicious content/threats.

This is a restriction set in place by Apple on a system level due to the nature of the profile.

<p><b><center><u>FAQ:</u></center></b><br><b>Why does my device say "This iDevice is supervised and managed"?</u></b><br><br>At no point is your device actually TRULY supervised. The message in Settings can cause alarm (and so it should under legitimate circumstances) but MYbloXX for iOS doesn’t actually supervise (or “manage”) your device.<br><br>MYbloXX for iOS uses a hidden stock Apple feature (usually only available to devices that are supervised under Mobile Device Management (MDM)) in order to block ads, revokes, miners etc. Under normal circumstances, this would require a person to manually supervise their device with Apple Configurator 2. This not only requires a Mac but also requires restoring your device.<br><br>The beauty of being jailbroken, we can SPOOF this setting, fooling iOS into BELIEVING it’s in a “supervised” state. Obtaining “spoofed supervised” status was simple: Changing one key string (“isSupervised”) in CloudConfigurationDetails.plist from “false” to “true”.<br><br>You can try this for yourself <a href="filza:///var/containers/Shared/SystemGroup/systemgroup.com.apple.configurationprofiles/Library/ConfigurationProfiles/CloudConfigurationDetails.plist">HERE</a> (Opens Filza).<br><br>You’ll see that the “warning” message is now in Settings.<br><br>Again, at no point is your device TRULY supervised... This would require YOU physically restoring your device in your possession. MYbloXX simply tricks iOS into thinking it is to allow the installation (this is also why MYbloXX for iOS is available for stock users as they have the option to legitimately supervise their device to use it).
                        <br><br><br><br>
    
                        <b>Can I remove the supervised message in Settings?</u></b><br><br>YES! <b><u>AFTER</b></u> you've installed the MYbloXX for iOS profile, you can use the <b>Disable Spoofing (Remove Message)</b> button in MYbloXX for iOS Settings to remove this message.<br><br><b>NOTE:</b> THIS REVERTS SUPERVISION SPOOFING ENTIRELY. If for whatever reason you remove the MYbloXX for iOS profile, you will need to use the <b>Enable Supervision Spoofing</b> option prior to reinstalling the profile.
<br><br><br><br>
                        <b>Does this block ads systemwide or just Safari?</u></b><br><br><b>SYSTEMWIDE!</b> MYbloXX for iOS blocks ads, revokes, trackers, miners and more in all browsers, games, tweaks and apps that use external/dedicated ad servers!
                <br><br><br><br>
                                        <b>Does MYbloXX for iOS work in stock mode?</u></b><br><br><b>YES!</b> MYbloXX for iOS xBlocking technology works in both jailbroken AND stock mode!
<br><br><br><br>
        <b>How often is MYbloXX for iOS updated?</u></b><br><br>MYbloXX for iOS is updated by hand by yours truly as reports come in/as I find ad-servers... Updates are typically more than once per day!
<br><br><br><br>
        <b>How do I get the updates?</u></b><br><br>No enduser interaction is required! Your device will automatically call out and receive the latest PAC rules from the MYXXdev GitHub repository. This will only occur when you use something that requires an active internet connection so there's no fear of overnight/standby battery drain. Sit back, relax and enjoy up to the minute protection!
<br><br><br><br>
        <b>Will I have to update anything in Cydia?</u></b><br><br>This package will rarely receive updates... Only if features are added/changed that require a full package update. Everything else is handled by the PAC automatically.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Does this block YouTube ads?</u></b><br><br><b>NO!</b> Some apps/services self-host their ads... YouTube being one of those services. This requires patching out the ads in the app directly with a separate tweak. Why? The ads are hosted on the same servers as the content itself - Blocking the ad-server would block the service entirely... Very smart on their behalf but annoying for us!<br><br><u><i>Services that use this ad-hosting technique:</u><br>
<br>- Facebook/Messenger
<br>- Instagram
<br>- Reddit
<br>- Snapchat
<br>- Twitch
<br>- Twitter
    <br>- YouTube</i>
<br><br>I recommend using <a href="https://haoict.github.io/cydia/">Haoict's</a> family of ad-blocking patches/tweaks alongside MYbloXX for iOS for these particular apps.
<br><br>
<b>NOTE:</b><br><br><u>Snapchat</u> - <i>They have recently started moving their ads from snapads.com to the same servers that host stories and Snaps. MYbloXX for iOS will still block the majority of ads until they fully transition but it's possible you'll see a small percentage of them. This requires a patch to remove them completely but it's unlikely that will happen due to their stance on tweaks injecting into their app.</i>
<br><br><u>YouTube</u> - <i>There are multiple tweaks available to block YouTube ads. I recommend <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/jhe0g7/free_release_youtopia_the_perfect_youtube/">YouTopia</a> by sinfool... Lightweight and FREE.</i>
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Does this block Cercube/Watusi banner ads?</u></b><br><br><b>NO!</b> MYbloXX for iOS blocks ads that are hosted on dedicated/external servers. Removing these types of hard-coded self-promotional banners is considered piracy and will NOT be removed by MYbloXX for iOS. Some tweaks use this method to encourage purchasing a license... Please support the developers!
<br><br><br><br>
<b>How do I fully remove MYbloXX for iOS?</u></b><br><br>You can remove this profile/package at any time using your choice of package manager (Cydia etc.) as well as/or navigating to Settings - General - Profiles & Device Management - MYbloXX for iOS.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>MYbloXX for iOS blocks app revokes?</u></b><br><br><b>YES!</b> MYbloXX for iOS blocks apps revokes meaning even if a certificate is revoked for an app you have downloaded from a third-party store, it will continue to open and remain VERIFIED even in stock mode!<br><br>NOTE: This will only work if the CERTIFICATE OWNER revokes the certificate. If this happens, it will continue to open and last until the expiration date of the certificate. HOWEVER, If APPLE remove the developer account attached to the certificate entirely, the application will unverify and crash on launch.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Can I delete the MYbloXX app?</u></b><br><br>The MYbloXX app is included in installation for reporting purposes (and initial installation). Please use this to report any ads or issues you have. If you must, you can hide the icon with Lynx, Springtomize, HideYouApps etc.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>Can I uninstall the MYbloXX for iOS package after installing the profile?</u></b><br><br>You'll lose the integrated pop-up/redirect blocker (TabBlocker) that's included in the package as well as the ease of reporting/profile re-installation. I'd recommend hiding the app icon opposed to complete removal.
<br><br><br><br>
<b>How can I support your work?</u></b><br><br>Donations are not required but definitely appreciated. It takes a lot of work to ensure MYbloXX for iOS is efficient and up to date. Although everything updates for you as an enduser automatically, it's still very much so manual research and data entry on my end. If you wish to donate to support continued development for years to come, a PayPal donation page is setup <a href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=myxxdev%40myxxfm.com&currency_code=USD">HERE.</a> Thank you in advance for your generosity. MYbloXX for iOS relies soley on donations since it cannot be monetized by ads for obvious reasons ;)
<br><br><br><br>
<b>What is MYXX FM?</u></b><br><br>MYXX FM is another of my projects that I own/operate... I included MYXX FM branding simply for exposure and for those that enjoy music that wish to support another of my hobbies... Again, commercial/ad free so non-monetized but it's something I enjoy doing.
